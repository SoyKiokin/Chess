This project is made entirely made with C++ using the multimedia library called SFML to draw stuff on screen.

This is the version 1.0 of my chess project. The only thing I added
is a simple gameplay: pieces movement, castle, promotion, captures, "en passant" (very important).
Stay tuned for more versions of the project!

(You can use my code as long as you give me credits!)
