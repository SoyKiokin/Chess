This project is made entirely made with C++ using the multimedia library called SFML to draw stuff on screen.

This is the version 1.0 of my chess project. The only thing I added
is a simple gameplay: pieces movement, castle, promotion, captures, "en passant" (very important).
Stay tuned for more versions of the project!

(You can use my code as long as you give me credits!)

Edit 09/07/2024: I never updated the game, it was terribly written at the moment so I also doubt you want to use this shitty code. 
It was just a fun project I decided to do and I highly recommend to try to do a chess game if you want a fun and challenging project to do.
